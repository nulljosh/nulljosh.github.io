        <h1>Psalms 23:5</h1>
        <p>
            You prepare a table before me
            in the presence of my enemies;
            you anoint my head with oil;
            my cup overflows.
        </p>
        <h1>Ezekiel 25:17</h1>
        <p>
            I will execute great vengeance on them with wrathful rebukes.
            Then they will know that I am the LORD, when I lay my
            vengeance upon them.
        </p>
        <h1>Mark 11:24</h1>
        <p>
            Therefore I tell you, <mark>whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have
            received it, and it will be yours</mark>. And whenever you stand praying,
            forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your
            Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.‚Äù
