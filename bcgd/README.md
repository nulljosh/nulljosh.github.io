# BC Garage Doors (BCGD) - Growth Plan

Modern redesign of [bcgaragedoors.ca](https://bcgaragedoors.ca) and launchpad for a service-business automation platform.

Live site: [heyitsmejosh.com/bcgd](https://heyitsmejosh.com/bcgd/)

## What this is

BCGD has two layers:

1. Conversion website (now)
- High-intent local landing experience
- Emergency-first call/quote paths
- Trust stack (30 years local, reviews, proof)

2. Service ops system (next)
- AI phone handling (after-hours + overflow)
- Scheduling + dispatch automation
- Quote follow-up + reminders
- Lead-to-paid pipeline visibility
- Payment reminders + reactivation

The site is the wedge. The system is the compounding engine.

## Goal and reality

Goal: build toward a billion-dollar outcome.

Reality:
- One local operator alone won’t reach $1B.
- The path is proving ROI at BCGD, then packaging and scaling the same operating system across many service businesses.

## Step-by-step path (simple)

Starting point:
- 30-year trusted business
- Immediate target: drive to $1M+ annual revenue faster

Step 1: Win the estimate moment
- Primary CTA: book estimate now
- Minimal form + fast confirmation
- Clear response SLA

Step 2: Promote proof
- Lead with 30-year credibility
- Real jobs, photos, reviews
- Tight conversion copy

Step 3: Tight local growth loop
- Fast response on every lead
- Missed-call recovery automation
- Every lead tracked in pipeline

Step 4: Productize internal tools
- Apps for lead inbox, scheduling, pipeline, payments
- Reuse system for websites, newsletters, and customer comms
- Add natural-language commands for operators

Step 5: Sell the playbook
- Done-for-you setup + monthly ops fee
- Repeatable templates and workflows

Step 6: Scale platform
- Multi-account system
- AI calls + websites + newsletters + ops layer
- Expand to adjacent verticals (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roofing)

## Top 6 builds next (fastest path to cash)

1) Estimate Funnel Engine
- One-click estimate CTA across site, SMS, missed-call flows
- KPI: lead -> estimate-booked conversion

2) Missed-Call Recovery Autopilot
- Auto SMS + callback queue + follow-up after missed calls
- KPI: missed-call recovery rate

3) AI Receptionist + Call Triage (Callie)
- After-hours/overflow handling, emergency priority
- KPI: calls answered rate, booking rate from calls

4) Job Pipeline App (Lead -> Paid)
- Single ops view for status, owner, next action
- KPI: lead -> booked time, booked -> paid time

5) Follow-up + Newsletter Engine
- Quote reminders + seasonal reactivation campaigns
- KPI: quote close rate, reactivation revenue

6) Natural-Language Ops Layer
- Commands like “book this” / “follow up pending quotes”
- KPI: ops time saved, error reduction

## Realistic but bullish timeline

- Week 1: Estimate Funnel + baseline analytics
- Week 2: Missed-Call Recovery
- Weeks 3-4: AI Receptionist (after-hours first)
- Weeks 5-6: Job Pipeline v1
- Week 7: Follow-up + Newsletter v1
- Week 8: Natural-Language Ops v1

90-day targets:
- 20-35% faster response time
- 10-20% lift in lead -> booked conversion
- 15-25% lift in missed-call recovery
- 1 repeatable package sold to a second local operator

## Go-to-market

Stage A: BCGD proof case
- Show measurable before/after lift

Stage B: Nearby operators
- Sell same system in Lower Mainland

Stage C: Productized plans
- Starter: phone + booking
- Growth: follow-up + pipeline
- Pro: payments + reactivation + analytics

## Revenue model

Hybrid:
- Setup fee
- Monthly platform fee
- Optional performance fee

## Operating rules

- No feature without KPI tie-in
- Ship weekly improvements tied to conversion or cash speed
- Reliability matters: logging, retries, alerts, runbooks
