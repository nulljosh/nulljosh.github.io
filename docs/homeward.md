# Architecture

Homeward is a lost and found pet board. Post lost or found pets with photos, search by location, and mark listings resolved when a pet is found. Built as a web app (Next.js on Vercel) and native iOS/macOS (SwiftUI), plus Kotlin Multiplatform (Android, desktop) and CLI (Swift). All frontends share one Supabase backend.

## How it runs

Web app: `app/layout.tsx` wraps the Next.js app with auth state. `app/page.tsx` (the landing) displays a wall of recent posts behind a scrim, then features and install links. Clicking a post or searching routes to `app/board/page.tsx`, which filters listings by type (lost/found) and search query. `app/post/page.tsx` accepts a photo and details (pet name, species, color, location, reward, etc), posts anonymously or as a signed-in user, and returns an edit link. `app/listing/page.tsx` shows the detail view: photo, map location, contact options. `app/listing/edit/page.tsx` lets the listing creator or any signed-in user mark the post resolved; on resolve, `supabase/functions/notify-found/index.ts` emails the owner if they provided one.

Auth is optional: posts are public and editable via a UUID `edit_token` link (Craigslist-style). Signing in (email/password, Apple, or Google) links new posts to `user_id` for later lookup. Password reset, account deletion, and OAuth sign-in all go through Supabase Auth pages.

iOS/macOS app: one SwiftUI target targeting both via `supportedDestinations`. `ListingsView.swift` is the board (filter by type, search, mark resolved). `PostListingView.swift` is the post form. `ListingDetailView.swift` shows detail. `AuthView.swift` handles email/password, Apple/Google sign-in via redirect scheme (`homeward://`), and password reset. `ListingStore.swift` holds listings in memory and syncs to Supabase; edit tokens are cached in UserDefaults.

KMP: common Listing data model; platform-specific UI in Compose mirroring the web and iOS flows.

CLI (TUI): reads listings from Supabase PostgREST directly, outputs as cards.

## Auth and tokens

Supabase Auth handles email/password, Apple OAuth, and Google OAuth. Users are optional: posts can be made anonymously and edited via a UUID `edit_token` link (like Craigslist). Signed-in posts set `user_id` and can be edited without the token. Edit tokens are cached per-device in iOS UserDefaults and in KMP's shared storage. Password reset links go through Supabase's email flow. Account deletion calls a shared `delete-account` Edge Function in the `spark` Supabase project (Homeward shares that project to avoid free-tier limits).

## Storage and RLS

One Supabase project shared with Sparkjar (both on free tier; limit is maxed). Listings table (`listings_data`) holds all posts; a view `listings` hides the `edit_token` and `user_id` columns for the public API. RLS policies:
- `listings` (public view): all rows readable by anyone
- `listings_data` (hidden): update gated on token match or user_id match via `update_listing` RPC; `create_listing` RPC handles insert for authenticated or anonymous users
- `resolve_listing` RPC: any signed-in user can call it; marks a listing resolved and triggers the email function

Photos are uploaded to Supabase Storage and referenced by URL in the listing record.

## Gotchas

- Edit tokens are UUIDs, not slugs. They cannot be guessed, so anonymous posts are secure.
- The `edit_token` column is not readable from the public `listings` view; direct table access via PostgREST returns 0 rows even if you're the owner, to prevent listing owners from accidentally discovering other owners' tokens.
- Supabase Auth sends password reset emails directly. Configure a custom email template in the dashboard to match the app's branding.
- iOS and macOS share one target; both entitlements files are needed if signing for real devices, or a build will fail with missing Mac profiles.
