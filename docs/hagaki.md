# Architecture

Mailbag helps people clean out a messy inbox fast. It connects to Gmail, Outlook, or iCloud Mail, scores each message for how likely it is junk (mismatched sender domain, spammy bulk patterns, fake urgency, unsubscribe headers), then files it into seven smart folders (Receipts, Travel, Dev, Newsletters, Social, Promotions, Junk). What the rules cannot place gets one pass through a small model on Cloudflare Workers AI. Mail from people stays in the inbox until the user presses Clear inbox, which archives it. The user can also unsubscribe, archive or delete. It runs as a web app and native iOS/macOS apps, all signing in with the mail provider's own login. It only checks mail when the user opens it, never on a schedule in the background.

## How it runs

User signs in with Google/Microsoft/Apple OAuth (native uses system browser via `ASWebAuthenticationSession`). Worker exchanges tokens with the provider, verifies IMAP/API access, stores session in KV with provider tag. Web/native UIs call `/api/messages` (lists inbox with scores) and `/api/action` (archive/delete/unsubscribe/organize) and `/api/organize` (file every message into its box in one pass: Gmail `batchModify` onto `Mailbag/<Box>` labels, iCloud `CREATE` + `UID MOVE`). Worker dispatches to provider-specific logic: Gmail and Outlook use REST APIs; iCloud uses raw IMAP over cloudflare:sockets. Scoring rules (sender domain mismatch, generic bulk greeting, urgency language, unsubscribe headers) are shared. Unsubscribe uses RFC 8058 one-click (POST to List-Unsubscribe URL).

| File | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `worker.js` | Cloudflare Worker. OAuth endpoints (`/auth/start`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/native`), message listing (`/api/messages`), actions (`/api/action`, `unsubscribe/archive/delete/organize`), bulk filing (`/api/organize`), the `categorize` rules, the `llmRefine` model pass, and `/api/sort` for mail the client read itself. Dispatches on provider (Gmail/Outlook/iCloud) to matching logic. Shared scoring rules across all three. |
| `landing/index.html` | Inbox UI (Connect button, message list, action buttons), marketing copy, run-history panel. Loads from Worker with `?embed&native=1` for native wrappers. |
| `ios/App/` | Native SwiftUI app. `SimpleInboxView` is the whole Mac window (a count and Clear inbox), `InboxView` is the iPhone and iPad list, `SettingsView` is the Mac settings window with accounts and sign out. `GoogleAuth` runs `ASWebAuthenticationSession` against Google's public PKCE client and trades tokens at `/auth/native`. `MacMail` (Debug builds only) reads Mail.app over Apple Events. |
| `ios/project.yml` + `ios/Mailbag.xcodeproj` | xcodegen project definition. iOS + macOS targets (shared Swift code, different size constraints). |
| `SKILL.md` | Claude Code skill for dev-tool alerting (Vercel/GitHub Actions/App Store Connect emails → filed to project). Separate from the app (requires Claude, not user-facing). |
| `wrangler.toml` | Cloudflare Worker deployment, KV namespace for sessions, secrets for OAuth client IDs. |
