# Architecture

Dotfiles is what makes a fresh Mac feel like this user's Mac in one command. It holds the shell setup, terminal look, and Claude Code skills (small automated helpers for tasks like document editing, deploying apps, or managing App Store listings), plus a few project templates to start new repos from. Files live in this repo and are linked into place in the home folder, so editing a file here changes the live config too. No passwords or API keys are committed; those live in separate files that git ignores.

## How it runs

**Installation**: `./install.sh` symlinks all tracked files into their target locations (e.g., `fish/config.fish` → `~/.config/fish/config.fish`), backing up any existing files to `.bak`. Run once after cloning, or re-run to sync changes from the repo.

**Shell config**: Zsh/Fish read their respective configs at login, which init tool managers (homebrew, nvm, rbenv), set environment variables and PATH, load fzf/starship/direnv, and source the gitignored `secrets.zsh`/`secrets.fish` for API keys.

**Claude Skills**: Symlinked into `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/`. Each skill is a self-contained tool: `skill-name/brief.md` (instructions), `skill-name/script.py` or equivalent (the implementation). When invoked via `/skill-name` in Claude Code, the script runs.

## Directories and structure

| Path | What it owns |
|---|---|
| `./install.sh` (42L) | Main symlink installer: backs up existing files to .bak, creates symlinks for all tracked config files |
| `fish/` | Fish shell config: abbreviations, aliases, functions, tool init (homebrew, nvm, rbenv, starship, fzf, direnv), sources secrets.fish |
| `zsh/` | Zsh shell config: PATH setup, plugins (starship, fzf, direnv), aliases, tool init, sources secrets.zsh |

| `claude/claude-skills/turnstile-spin/` | Cloudflare Turnstile widget scaffolder: generates boilerplate Cloudflare Worker + HTML/JS + tests |
| `claude/claude-skills/duolingo/` | Duolingo bot: Playwright script that solves Duolingo lessons (math, chess, language) headlessly, includes macOS menu-bar app for status |
| `claude/claude-skills/skill-creator/` | Interactive skill scaffolder: creates new skill template with brief.md, README, test harness, eval suite |
| `claude/claude-skills/icon-creator/` | App icon generator: creates 1024x1024 icons from SVG templates via Pixelmator or CLI |
| `claude/claude-skills/mcp-builder/` | MCP server scaffolder: generates boilerplate Model Context Protocol server with tool definitions |
| `claude/claude-skills/asc-name-creator/` | App Store Connect name prober: tests candidate app names by temporarily renaming a throwaway ASC record |
| `claude/claude-skills/architecture-svg/` | Architecture diagram renderer: takes hand-written JSON spec, renders house-style boxes-and-lines SVG |
| `infra/` | Infrastructure reference templates: API gateway (Go), KV store (Rust), search engine (Python), graphics renderer (Rust) |
| `notes/` | Personal reference site (Jekyll): health resources, school notes, timeline, master notes index |
| `vibe/` | Portfolio design reference: dark editorial aesthetic template, Figma-aligned CSS tokens, component showcase |
| `scaffold/` | Project template extracted from Tally: Express API server, PWA frontend, iOS/macOS native clients, auth (encrypted cookies, biometric unlock), deployment (Vercel + Blob) |

## Per-category depth

**Shell configs** (fish, zsh, starship): Each is static JSON or shell syntax. No runtime state. Fish uses function definitions (e.g., `function work`), zsh uses aliases + eval'd tool init. Secrets sourced at shell startup, not committed.

**Office document processing** (docx, xlsx, pptx): Python-heavy. Unpack ZIP archives, parse/validate XML against XSD schemas, repair structural errors (tracked changes, duplicate themes, invalid IDs), repack into binary office format. Shared helpers (`office/helpers/`) for ZIP extraction, OPC validation, relationship parsing. Validators split by format (base class + docx/pptx/redlining overrides).

**Skills** (40+ directories): Each is a self-contained tool. Brief describes user intent and instructions. Script (Python, Bash, Node, or Swift) is the implementation. Many inherit from Anthropic's official skill templates (docx/xlsx/pptx share structure). Most have test suites.

**Infra templates**: Go/Rust/Python reference implementations for common building blocks. Not deployed; used as copy-paste templates for new projects.

## Data storage and secrets

No data storage in the repo itself (it's read-only code). Secrets live in:
- `~/.config/fish/secrets.fish` (Fish shell vars, functions)
- `~/.config/zsh/secrets.zsh` (Zsh shell vars, exports)
- Never committed; should be regenerated after clone (`cp secrets.example.fish secrets.fish` if template exists)

API keys, GitHub tokens, Stripe live keys, Supabase PEMs all live in secrets only.

## External services and gotchas

- **Homebrew, nvm, rbenv**: Inited via shell config. Tools must be installed separately.
- **Starship**: Installed separately; config points to it. Catppuccin Mocha theme requires starship >= 1.0.
- **fzf, direnv**: Installed separately; shell config sources their init.
- **Pixelmator Pro** (icon-creator): Headless scripting requires Pro version and AppleScript support. Falls back to CLI rasterizer if unavailable.
- **LibreOffice** (docx/xlsx/pptx validators): Used for some validations; must be installed separately.
- **Vercel, Cloudflare CLI**: Must be installed; many skills assume they're in PATH.
- **GitHub CLI** (gh): Assumed present for pull-request operations.

## Known limitations

- No Windows/Linux support: shell configs are macOS-specific (fish/zsh, Starship, Ghostty all macOS-first).
- Skill execution is sequential (one at a time); no parallel skill runs.
- Office document repair is detection-only for some fault classes (e.g., PowerPoint chart axis mismatches); author must decide the fix.
- Duolingo bot requires live browser session; no API-only mode.
- Icon generator depends on Pixelmator for SVG rendering; vector-to-raster pipeline is not pure CLI.
- Skills that call external APIs (skill-creator eval, pdf OCR) incur per-call costs and have rate limits.
