# Architecture

Blockframe lets you sketch app wireframes out of text characters instead of shapes, like an ASCII art screen mockup you can drag and drop together. Pick a button, input field, or box from a palette, drop it on a grid, and export the result as plain text you can paste anywhere. It ships as a web app, iOS app, macOS app, and Android app (the Android and desktop versions share code written in Kotlin, a language that compiles to both). It has its own warm-paper look, separate from other apps' shared design system.

## How it runs

**Web**: React app in `src/App.jsx` renders a three-pane layout: toolbar (left), canvas (center), inspector (right). User selects a preset component from the palette, clicks to place it on the 100x50 character grid, drags to resize. Changes update a grid of characters in real time, exportable as plain text. No bundler, no build step for development (Vite in prod).

**iOS/macOS**: SwiftUI app in `ios/App/`. Canvas rendered as monospace Text (one Text per row, not per cell, for performance). Same grid engine as web (ported function-for-function from JavaScript). Persistent storage in Application Support folder.

**Android/Desktop (KMP)**: `kmp/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nulljosh/charwork/`. Shared engine logic ported to Kotlin. Platform-specific Compose UI in `kmp/composeApp/src/`.

## Gotchas

**Single-pane monospace grid**: Canvas is drawn as monospace Text, one row per Text() call (50 rows, not 5,000 cells) for performance. Font advance is uniform, so whole-line draw aligns cell boundaries with tap-math pxToCell.

**Ported engines must stay diffable**: `src/lib/engine.js`, `ios/App/Engine.swift`, and `kmp/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nulljosh/charwork/Engine.kt` are kept line-comparable across languages. Function signatures, variable names, and logic order are maintained so changes can be ported easily.

**Presets also diffable**: same as engines, all three Preset definitions (JS, Swift, Kotlin) are kept in sync manually, never auto-generated.

**Warm-paper theme is separate**: `src/tokens.css` imports Jaybulb portfolio tokens, then `src/index.css` redefines them with warm-paper overrides (paper bg, ink text, terracotta). Do not merge into shared tokens.

**No cloud sync**: grid state is device-local only (localStorage on web, Application Support on iOS/macOS, UserDefaults/SharedPreferences on KMP platforms).

**Character grid is 100x50**: default size, hardcoded in engine. Resizable via UI but stored as-is.

**Preset IDs are opaque**: preset.id is the key for exports/imports, must not change. Only label and template can be edited.

**Text export is plain ASCII**: no metadata, no metadata file needed. The grid IS the export.
