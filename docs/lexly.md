# Architecture

A gamified language and skills learning app featuring 12 languages plus math, science, programming, and BC curriculum content. Spaced-repetition exercises, daily streaks, and XP-based progression. Runs on web (PWA), iOS, macOS, and Android (Kotlin Multiplatform). Progress syncs via Supabase for signed-in users.

## How it runs

**Web**: browser loads `app/index.html`, runs `js/lingo-app.js` which is the entire app (state, auth, UI). User picks a course catalog, works through lessons (exercises rendered by the right type handler), earns XP/hearts, and progress is saved to Supabase (signed-in users) or localStorage (demo mode). No build step, no framework, pure vanilla JS/HTML/CSS.

**iOS**: `ios/Sources/iOS/LingoApp.swift` is the entry point, renders shared `CatalogView`. Supabase auth, progress sync on `syncFromCloud()`. The bundled `content/` (symlinked in Xcode) loads catalog and course packs. A daily reminder (UserNotifications) fires tomorrow if the user completes a lesson today.

**macOS**: `ios/Sources/macOS/LingoApp.swift` is the entry point (separate from iOS), renders `CatalogView`. Same auth and progress syncing as iOS.

**Android/Desktop (KMP)**: `kmp/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/nulljosh/lexly/AppScreen.kt` is the shared entry point, fetches catalog from the live web API.

## Data storage

**Supabase (spark project)**: auth (email+password, Apple, Google), `lingo_profiles` table (username, avatar), `lingo_progress` table (XP, streak, hearts, last played, SRS cards, lessons completed). RLS gates data to signed-in user.

**Browser localStorage** (web only): progress/SRS/auth (when not signed in or in demo mode).

**Device UserDefaults** (iOS/macOS): progress, SRS cards, daily reminder toggle, theme choice.

**Service Worker cache** (web): network-first for pages, cache-first for assets.

## Mechanics

**Spaced Repetition (SM-2)**: interval/factor/difficulty stored per exercise in `srs` column (both web and iOS write this shape). Card is due when `nextReviewDate <= today`. Correct answer increases interval, wrong answer decreases it.

**Daily Streak**: increments if user completes a lesson on a given day. Resets to 1 if missed. `lastPlayed` tracks the last day a lesson was completed.

**Hearts system**: 5 hearts by default, lose 1 per wrong answer, regain 1 after a period or by time. When 0, the user cannot proceed until hearts restore.

**XP and Trophies**: earn 10 XP per correct answer, unlock trophies (First Steps, Perfectionist, On Fire, etc.) based on conditions. Widget displays current XP.

## External services

**Supabase (spark project)**: auth, progress persistence, SRS card sync across devices.

**OpenSubtitles + Tatoeba**: language course generation, CC-BY 2.0 FR license (attribution in landing, iOS settings).

**Web API**: KMP fetches the live catalog from `lexly.heyitsmejosh.com/content/catalog.json`.

## Gotchas

**Content is data-driven**: every exercise type (translation, cloze, math, etc.) is defined by JSON fields. Web and iOS renderers must both read the same fields. `tools/validate-catalog.js` enforces this, keep it in sync when adding a type.

**Platform auth differs on purpose**: web gates the catalog behind sign-in (with `?demo=1` escape hatch per App Review 5.1.1(v)). iOS/macOS do NOT gate content (sign-in unlocks only progress sync) for the same App Review reasons. Do not "fix" this inconsistency without a recheck with legal.

**SRS shape is cross-platform**: SM-2 cards in Supabase must decode identically on web and iOS. Any JSON shape change breaks one or both.

**Service worker cache evicts by version**: `CACHE_VERSION` in `sw.js` controls cache eviction. Bump it to force a cache clear.

**No book content**: a previous `books` category in catalog.json was removed 2026-08-30 because Apple rejected the app for having book summaries (now Bookrank's product). Categories are now explicit in `CatalogView.categoryOrder` rather than sorted alphabetically.

**Daily reminder is local only**: UserNotifications, no push backend. Permission is asked after the first completed lesson. Reschedules to tomorrow after every lesson (so a day with a lesson never gets nagged).

**Content symlink**: `ios/Sources/Resources/content` is symlinked to `content/`, so web edits reach the app bundle automatically without a copy step.
