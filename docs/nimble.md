# Architecture

Nimble is an instant-answer search engine. Type a query; get the answer in milliseconds with the source. Deployed as a macOS HUD and menu bar app, iOS app, and web app. Local math evaluation (no network), factual questions answered by AI or DuckDuckGo, definitions from Wikipedia. Theme system and user-selectable AI engine (Nimble proxy, Claude, OpenAI, or Ollama).

## How it runs

macOS app: `Sources/NimbleApp.swift` registers a global hotkey (⌥Space) to show a borderless HUD window at the top-center of the screen. User types a query; `AppState.performQuery()` classifies it via `QueryEngine.classifyQuery()` (math, factual, definition, or unknown), runs the appropriate handler, and populates `state.result`. `SearchView.swift` watches `state.result` and renders the answer via `ResultView.swift` (specific views for math, definitions, color output, unit conversion, and graphs). Settings (`SettingsView.swift`) persist to `~/.Nimble/Preferences.json`, including theme and AI engine choice. The menu bar icon opens the HUD with a click.

iOS app: `Sources/iOS/NimbleApp.swift` wraps the search in a NavigationStack. No global hotkey; users tap to open. Preferences stored in UserDefaults. Includes a what's-new sheet on version bump.

Web app: `docs/index.html` (HTML + `docs/engine.js`) runs the same QueryEngine logic in JavaScript. Calls `docs/engine.js`'s own `tryMath()`, `tryConvert()`, `tryGraph()`, then falls through to an answer proxy for factual queries.

Answer pipeline:
1. **Math**: local `QueryEngine.evaluateMath()` (hand-written lexer + parser, replaces NSExpression which silently dropped trailing input)
2. **Conversion**: local unit table + math (e.g., "5 miles in km")
3. **Graphing**: fetch points from Curvely's `/api/sample` endpoint
4. **Factual/definition**: DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API, fallback to Wikipedia search
5. **AI fallback**: user's chosen engine (Nimble proxy on Workers AI, Claude, OpenAI, or Ollama)

## Query classification

`QueryEngine.classifyQuery()` returns a QueryType enum (math, factual, definition, or unknown). Logic:
- If the query starts with digits, operators, or math functions (sin, sqrt, etc), it's math
- If it contains "what is", "who is", "define", etc, it's a definition request
- If it ends with a question mark or contains question words, it's factual
- Otherwise, try math first; if that fails, fall through to factual

Math evaluation uses a hand-written lexer + recursive-descent parser (replacing NSExpression which silently ignored trailing input like "2+2x" reporting 4 instead of failing). Supports: basic arithmetic, 40+ trig/log functions, unit conversion.

## AI engine selection

Four engines available:
- **Nimble** (default): Cloudflare Worker + Workers AI (Gemma + Qwen3), free, no API key needed
- **Claude/OpenAI/Ollama**: user provides API key or local URL; stays on device, never sent to Nimble's servers

Engine choice saved in Preferences and survives app restart. Missing API key = silent fallback to Nimble proxy.

## Gotchas

- macOS window has no title bar (`.fullSizeContentView` + no `.titled` style mask). Restoring `.titled` will break the flush layout.
- math parsing intentionally rejects "2+2x" with an error instead of silently interpreting "2+2" like NSExpression. This strictness is a feature, not a bug.
- Update checking runs on launch but throttles to 24-hour intervals (stored in Preferences).
- Query results are held in-memory; closing the app forgets them. This is intentional (no logging).
