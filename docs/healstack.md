# Architecture

Healstack helps someone track what they take and how their body is doing. Users log doses and substances, biometrics, and lab results, and get a warning if two things they take are known to interact badly, plus track bodywork routines like acupuncture or reflexology. It runs as a web app and an iOS app, both built from the same code where possible. Sign-in is through Supabase (email/password or OAuth). Paying users get cross-device sync and other extras, handled by small Cloudflare-hosted functions and a key-value store.

## How it runs

**Web**: User opens the site, signs in with Supabase credentials. Dashboard lists active dose entries from localStorage, checks interactions, renders health metrics. Logging a dose checks the interaction database. Pro features (CSV export, cross-device sync) call Cloudflare Functions endpoints (stripe.js for checkout, sync.js for data push/pull).

**iOS**: Launch `HealstackApp.swift`, which initializes Supabase client from Info.plist, prompts auth if needed. Same UI surfaces the five core tabs: Home (Dashboard), Substances, Journal, Insights, Profile. Dose logging, interaction checking, and biometric tracking work identically to web, using the same hooks/models, backed by device localStorage.

Data syncs via `functions/api/sync.js` only for Pro users; free users stay local. Lab PDFs are parsed client-side by `src/utils/parseLifeLabs.js` using PDF.js from CDN.

## Data flow

**New dose entry** (web): User taps "add" → AddEntryModal → picks substance via search (Substances hook filters the database), enters dose/route/notes, optionally adds rating → submit calls `useDoseLog.addEntry()` → writes to localStorage key `dose:log` as JSON → InteractionChecker searches `data/substances.js` for known interactions with any active substance in the log → warns if found → entry persists until deleted.

**Biometrics**: User uploads weight/BP/HR/sleep via Health page → parsed into BiometricEntry → stored in localStorage key `dose:health_metrics` → LabResults page runs `insightEngine` statistical correlations against dose log to surface patterns (e.g. "sleep drops 1.5 hours after caffeine after 2pm").

**Lab PDF upload**: User selects LifeLabs PDF → browser calls `parseLifeLabs` with file buffer → PDF.js decodes stream, OCR-like text extraction, regex matches lab panels and marker values, includes reference ranges → LabResult stored in localStorage key `dose:lab_results`, rendered with flag badges (normal/low/high/critical based on reference range).

**Sync** (Pro): User enables cross-device sync → Browser calls `functions/api/sync.js` with current dose log + auth token → Worker verifies token hash against DOSE_KV store, rate-limits to 10 reqs/min, writes/retrieves JSON from KV → next device pulls the same data.

**Stripe checkout** (Pro unlock): User taps Pro → calls `functions/api/stripe.js` → creates Stripe session with Supabase user id in client_reference_id → redirect to Stripe hosted checkout → user pays → Stripe POSTs webhook to `stripe-webhook.js` → Worker verifies signature, reads client_reference_id, writes `pro:<userId>` flag to KV → iOS/web both check this flag on app load to unlock Pro UI.

## Data storage

**Web/iOS local**: localStorage (DOM Storage on web, NSUserDefaults iOS analogue via localStorage wrapper). Keys: `dose:log` (main dose entry array), `dose:health_metrics`, `dose:health_screenshots`, `dose:supplements`, `dose:custom_substances`, `dose:routine:checked`, `dose:facemaxxing:checked`, `dose:lab_results`. Plain JSON, 4KB soft limit per key before silent truncation (web limitation). No schema versioning; app handles stale formats gracefully.

**Supabase auth**: email+password account in spark project, optional Apple/Google OAuth.

**Cloudflare KV**: DOSE_KV namespace, only Pro user data: rate-limit token hashes, sync payloads (JSON dose logs keyed by `sync:<userId>`), and `pro:<userId>` boolean flags. No encryption (HTTPS in transit, Cloudflare-managed).

## External services

**Supabase** (spark shared project): Auth users table, PASSWORD_RECOVERY email event hook (password reset emails via Resend).

**Cloudflare**: Pages for hosting, Functions for API, KV for data store, custom domain managed via Pages API (not DNS alone).

**Stripe**: Payment processing for Pro tier (CSV export + cross-device sync). Secrets not yet configured (app is free).

**PDF.js CDN** (jsDelivr): Client-side LifeLabs PDF parsing, loaded on demand.

**Resend**: Sends Supabase password-recovery emails via authmail Cloudflare Worker.

## Gotchas

- Interaction checker searches a static curated list (data/substances.js), not a real pharmacology DB. Misses many real interactions. Must warn user to consult a real pharmacist.
- Lab result reference ranges are baked in per marker (LabResult model). Different labs have different ranges (LifeLabs vs Quest vs local). PDF parser tries to extract ranges from the PDF itself, but falls back to defaults if parsing fails.
- localStorage truncates silently at 4KB per key. Dose log heatmaps compress poorly; very active users hit the ceiling. Pro sync is the workaround (pushes to KV). No on-device archiving.
- Stripe Pro unlock writes a `pro:<userId>` flag but does not revoke it after subscription ends. Deliberate: app is personal-use only, no recurring charge logic yet.
- iOS app bundle ID and URL scheme are still `dose` (not `healstack`) to avoid App Store re-linking on the 2026-07 rename from Dose.
- Biometric correlations are statistical only. A dose-sleep correlation doesn't prove causation. insightEngine computes mean and stddev over 7/14/30-day windows; user must reason about causality themselves.
